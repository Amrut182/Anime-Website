# Anime-Website
To create an Social Media platform for anime nerds !

## Getting Started : 
- Fork this repository into your profile.
![Fork](https://github-images.s3.amazonaws.com/help/bootcamp/Bootcamp-Fork.png)

- Clone it on local machine.
```
git clone <your repository's url>
```
- Set this repository as upstream.
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ParitoshGavali/Anime-Website.git
```
- Check the status of origin and upstream.
```
git remote -v
```
> Help, I can't understand this origin/upstream BS!! :dizzy_face:
>> - origin refers to the GitHub repository you cloned from.
>> - upstream refers to the other GitHub repository you want to pull or push changes to.
>> - So, after entring the above command you should see forked git repo in origin and this git repo in upstream.

>**_PRO TIP_ :sunglasses: ** : origin is set automatically by git but the upstream is just a convention used by almost all git users, so you can use any name instead of upstream.

> Now you are ready to code :star_struck: \
> Just kidding! :disappointed: \
> Read the next topic and then I promise that you will be ready to start (or maybe not :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)
